          <h1>Crimes in India </h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 1cm;">Crime in India has been recorded since the British Raj, with comprehensive statistics now compiled annually by the <b>National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB)</b>, under the Ministry of Home Affairs (India)(MHA).
      <b>Indian Penal Code(IPC)</b> is the main criminal code of India intended to cover all all aspects of criminal law. This visualisation depicts state wise crimes commited in India between 2001 and 2012 under Indian Penal Code(IPC). 
      All the State/UT names are as per 2011 census. All the data used is taken from  <a href ="https://data.gov.in/" style="color:#14bb7b" target = "_blank"> Open Government Data Platform India</a> website. 
      More than a fifth of all registered crime were classified as offences affecting the human body, which included violent

            <p style="margin-top: 1cm;">Location has a significant impact on crime in India. Madya Pradesh had the highest crime rate among
               all States of India. All Northeast States and union territories had a 
               significantly lower crime rate. Contrary to popular belief, 
               the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh had the 5th highest crime rate in the country. States in Northeast India have consistently reported much 
               lower crime rates, with 4 of the 5 states having the lowest 
               crime in being from the region. This visualisation depicts comparison of States in the terms of total Crimes happened between 2001 and 2012 
              in respective states. The % refers to the amount of crimes happened in particular state 
            to the total crimes happened in India between this period. It is quite drastic to see the higher % difference between the states. </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 1cm;">Crime in India is very common and happens in many different ways. Along with violent crimes (like homicide, robbery, and assault), and property crimes (like burglary,
             theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson), there are major problems with organized crime, the illegal drug trade, arms trafficking, corruption, and many other forms of crime. This visualisation

            <p style="margin-top: 1cm;"> According to the <b>National Crime Records Bureau of India</b>, 
              reported incidents of crime against women increased 6.4% during 2012, and a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes. 
              Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women. 
              Most typically, these acts are committed by men as a result of the long-standing gender inequalities present in the country. 
              India's Gender Inequality Index rating of 0.524 in 2012, putting it in the bottom 20% of ranked countries for that year.
              This visualisation depicts the amount of persons arrested due to crime against women during 2012 in the terms of aged and sex.
              We can clearly depicts most of the crime against women are done by Men age between 18-30 followed by Men aged between 30-45.
              States like UP, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal which have lower literacy rates are having more crime against women.

In 2006, 5,102,460 cognisable crimes were committed including 1,878,293 (IPC) crimes and 3,224,167 Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes, 
              with an increase of 1.5% over 2005 (50,26,337). IPC crime rate in 2006 was 167.7 compared to 165.3 in 2005 showing an increase of 1.5% in 2006 over 2005. The results 
              suggest that rates of murder, robbery, burglary, theft, and rioting 
              follow declining trends, while rates of rape show an increasing trend between 1971 and 2011. The homicide trend is the only crime category following the global crime trend. This visualisation depicts
